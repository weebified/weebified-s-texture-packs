                    <div id="imgP" class="paragraph">Just as I'm asking myself when developing this, you're probably thinking <i>"What on god's earth led 
                    you to make such an abomination?"</i>. I'll spare you the details but basically 
                    my friend kana produced a bunch of pictures of him wearing thigh highs and sent those to us, his friend 
                    group, now this is where you come in, behind this puzzle those 
                    pictures reside, untouched <i>(yet)</i>. Everything in this puzzle is very much so inspired by the real 
                    life person who this was made for, the color scheme matches the colors he likes <i>(kinda)</i>, the 
                    solutions to the different parts of the puzzle, etc. I should also metion he has agreed to me making this,
                    he even suggested a few things.

                <div class="paragraph">Alright so you've listenened to me rambling for long enough, let's get you started with this. Somewhere on 
                    the internet, on something that has a connection to me there is the first part of the puzzle, there are no rules, so do whatever you need to do to obtain those pictures. Figure it out and 
                    you'll be lead to the rest of the puzzle.
