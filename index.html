                    Shiina-chan is a discord bot made by me, weebified, just like Shiina's mod it was a way for me 
                    to experiment with coding. I learnt alot about JS and how bad i am at using it. You can find 
                    the commands for it on the dedicated page for the bot.

                    Shiina's pack was the first spark of this hobby, it was one of the first texture packs I've made.
                    Sure I did'nt spend alot of time on the texture pack but it was the first project I made, it was my
                    first time retexturing armor and items, gaining alot of expirience in the meantime.
