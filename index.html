                    Shiina's pack was the first spark of this hobby, it was one of the first texture packs I've made. Sure I did'nt spend alot of time on the texture pack but it was the first project I made, it was my first time retexturing armor and items, gaining alot of expirience in the mean time.

                        A texture pack to "lewdify" the minecraft, replacing sounds and textures with more lewd ones. Changing the entire feel of the game, and perhaps, changing your mental state making you almost, or more, horny as I was when I started this project.
